# FieldValidator

This is a sample project which demonstrates how to implement Form validation which can be used through out multiple projects.

For this project, I added 4 cases of field types:
- Email
- Password
- Phone
- Normal (optional)

I have created a enum FieldType which handles the minimum and maximum length setting as well as the validation message to be displayed.

These can be easily customized and enhance according to the project requirement.

Furthermore, these functions can be easily tested. I've also added a sample unit testing for these validation functions in FieldValidatorsTests.
